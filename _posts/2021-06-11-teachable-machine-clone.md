## Introduction
This article serves as a note for cloning tensorflow open source project, teachable machine.

## Why
I just want to learn tensorflow and this project seems can practice both image and audio recognization.

## How
### Frontend
* [**parcel**](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) to create a project and add [**.gitignore**](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/examples/blob/master/.gitignore)
* [**bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/parcel/) for style
* [**posthtml**](https://v2.parceljs.org/languages/html/) for partial render; however, in the partial render part, I need to refresh or restart the website several times and the CSS seems to be unstable, and I think this is a good chance to practice SPA and save more calculation power for tensorflow, so I turned to reactJS.

After deleting all files
* [**react**](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for SPA.

The basic layouts with header and cards of this project would be 

Then for webcam snapshot, please install [**webcamJS**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webcamjs)

我可能會需要一個 layout，因為 header 是重複的
