## How

A really basic object can be created as follow, which is literally a function that return a object with css and html and can be called somewhere else
```
function Card() {
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```
and we can call this card multiple times in another file as follow
```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-100 font-Roboto antialised">
      <Header />
      <Aside />
      <main className="ml-24 pt-16">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-4 row-gap-10 col-gap-2">
          <Card />
          <Card />
          ...
        </div>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```
However, if we want to truly have a component that possess some behavior, then we need to have functions and the functions should have the abilities to change the component's states; as a result, I am going to modify these two components as follow:

#### Card
```
class Card extends Component {

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="col-span-4 sm:col-span-4 md:col-span-2 lg:col-span-1 xl:col-span-1 flex flex-col items-center" >
        ...
        <div className="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg -mt-4 w-64">
          <div className="py-5 px-5">
            <span className="font-bold text-gray-800 text-lg">{this.props.projectName}</span>
            <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
              ...
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
as you can see, there is a way to chnange the Name `this.props.projectName` and we can customize the projectName with renderCard function in the App component
```
class App extends React.Component {

  renderCard(name) {
    return (
      <Card
        projectName={name}
      />
    );
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="bg-gray-100 font-Roboto antialised">
        <Header />
        <Aside />
        <main className="ml-24 pt-16">
          <div className="grid grid-cols-4 row-gap-10 col-gap-2">
            {this.renderCard("image project")}
            {this.renderCard("audio project")}
            {this.renderCard("pose project")}
          </div>
        </main>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
As you can see, the `<Card />` can be customized by `renderCard` in App component.
