### Introduction

Model is not database or table but a class in rails to communicate with database.

#### The rule of name in rails

For example,

+------------+-------------+  
| model name | table name  |  
+------------+-------------+  
| User       | users       |  
| Category   | categories  |  
| OrderItem  | order\_items |  
+------------+-------------+

### Why

With model in rails, we can use same commands to communicate with all databases such as MySQL, Postgresql, …etc.

### CRUD in Model

#### What is ORM?

ORM = Object Relational Mapping, helping user to communicate with database with the concept of object. For example,

User.all

means

SELECT \* FROM users;

In rails console, the following codes does the same thing in controller CRUD

#### C (Create)

For example, to create a candidate

user = Candidate.new(name: "aaa", age: 19)  
user.save

#### R (Read)

Get the first candidate:

Candidate.first

Get the top three candidate:

Candidate.first(3)

find data by id:

Candidate.find(1)  
Candidate.find\_by(id: 1)

Read all data

Candidate.all

Set some condition with where

Candidate.where("age > 18", gender: "female")

Set some condition just like aggregation in SQL

Candidate.count  
Candidate.sum(:age)

Find all table name

```
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables
```

#### U (Update)

For example, for changing the candidate’s name with id = 1, in rails console,

candidate = Candidate.find\_by(id: 1)  
candidate.name = "hahaha"  
candidate.save

or using update directory

candidate.update(name: "hahahaha", age: 20)

#### D (Delete)

For example, if I want to delete the candidate with id = 1

Candidate.destroy(1)

or

Candidate.delete(1)

we also can do it with condition

Candidate.destroy\_all("id = 1")

### Scope

Given we want to have all candidates with age > 18, in controller,

class CandidatesController < ApplicationController  
    
  def index  
    @candidate\_18 = Candidate.where("age > 18")  
  end

end

However, if there is going to have more condition, the coding will be hard to maintain. As a result, we can use scope in model:

class Candidate < ApplicationRecord  
    
  scope :above\_18, -> { where(age > 18) }  

end

Then the coding in controller can be rewritten

class CandidatesController < ApplicationController  
    
  def index  
    @candidate\_18 = Candidate.above\_18  
  end

end

### Model Migration

#### What is migration?

Migration is a mechanism like version control for the database. Any changes related to database setting, will be recorded in migrations.

#### Add Migration files

if we want to create a new model, a corresponded migration file created. For example, let’s generate a model called Article with columns: title, content, is\_online

$ rails g model Article title content:text is\_online:boolean

Then in db/migrate, we can see a file, timestamp\_create\_articles.rb:

aclass CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration\[6.1\]  
  def change  
    create\_table :articles do |t|  
      t.string :title  
      t.text :content  
      t.boolean :is\_online  
        
      t.timestamps  
    end  
  end  
end

by reading the codes, the change method is to create a table with title (string), content (text), is\_online (boolean) and timestamp records the timing of this change

#### Delete migration files

If you created wrong migration file, delete it with

```
rails d migration SameMigrationNameAsUsedToGenerate
```

Notice! only destroy this migration file before `db:migrate`

#### Migration

Execute the migration

rails db:migrate

#### Rollback

If we want to cancel migrations; for example, we know that we want to rollback 3 steps of migrations

$ rails db:rollback STEP=3

However, the Rollback method is not recommended because a small leak will sink the great ship. As a result, we should use another migration to modify database to what we want; for example, if we want to add a column to an existed table, we can add another generate migration

$ rails g migration add\_column\_to\_articles

Then the following migration

class AddColumnToArticle < ActiveRecord::Migration\[5.0\]  
  def change  
  end  
end

Then we can modify it

class AddColumnToArticle < ActiveRecord::Migration\[5.0\]  
  def change  
    add\_column :article, :column, :string

  end  
end

Then execute migrate

rails db:migrate

#### Schema

If we want to know the which migration ever be executed

$ rails db:migrate:status
