### tone

There are many pitch-accent in Japan and we follow the standard way. We use numbering to represent the tones as follow:

1. `1` means lower the tone right after the first letter
2. `2` means lower the tone right after the second letter and we need to raise the tone after the second letter so that we can lower the tone after second letter
3. `3` means lower the tone right after the third letter and also we need to raise the tone after the second letter and keep the tone up until the third letter
4. `4` means lower the tone right after the forth letter
5. `0` means there is no position to lower the tone, meaning the tone is always high after the first letter

#### sentence

1. pronounce subsidiary and the noun together and subsidiary follows the tone of the last letter of noun
2. The number of 胃(い) is 0 and the number of 目(め) is 1, they have different effects to the tone of subsidiary; the tone of は after 胃 should be higher but the tone of は after 目 should be lower.
