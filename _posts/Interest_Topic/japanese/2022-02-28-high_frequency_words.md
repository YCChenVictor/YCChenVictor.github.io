## Introduction

This is my japanese practice.

## Why?

Now I am living alone with no one to talk to, so I start to learn new things. For my experience, learning a language must start from high frequency words and then start to talk to someone.

## How?

I am going to create a json with key as English and item as Japanese and maybe build a frontend to show the words randomly.

## What?

```JSON
{
  'this': 'これ',
  'that': 'それ',
  'that over there': 'あれ',
  'I': '私(わたし)',
  'he': '彼',
  'she': '彼女(かのじょ)',
  'we': '私たち(watashitachi)',
  'they': '彼ら(karera)',

}
```
