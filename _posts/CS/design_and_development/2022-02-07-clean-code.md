## Introduction

Hard work then gain clean code.

1. get 'code-sense': practice with passion (like artist)
2. write code pleasing to read like articraft
3. compose a code to do 'one thing' well
4. write code with tests
5. write small code
6. care the code
7. build Expressiveness: good naming, good structure ... etc
8. avoid duplication

## Why?

Be better programmer -> Changes happens all the time -> software out of date all the time -> In software, 80% maintenance -> making software always ready to be repaired -> we need readable, easy to be re-do or refactor -> clean code -> write it with craftsmanship -> detailed, on our time

## How?

### Naming

1. Use Intention-Revealing Names
2. Avoid Disinformation
3. Make Meaningful Distinctions
4.
