## Introduction

Operating System serves as the communicator between computer hardware and computer software applications.

## Why?

Without it, the computer will not operate the Apps we want.

## How?

Try to explain the steps among the gap between App and hardware as follow:

1. user click an app on the computer UI
2. the app start to run and it need some computation
3. the data flow to operation system
4. operation system call hardware (CPU, RAM, I/O) to compute it
5. data sent back to OS
6. OS send data back to app
7. user get what they want in UI

## What?

Typically, functions as follow:

1. memory management
2. process management
3. device management
4. file management
5. security
6. control over system performance
7. job accounting
8. error detecting aids
9. coordination between other software and users

### memory management

Given processes in a computer, memory management checks how much memory to be allocated, what time to allocate the memory, and update the status of memory once some memory gets freed or unallocated.

### process management
