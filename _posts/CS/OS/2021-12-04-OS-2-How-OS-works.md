## Introduction

Operating System serves as the communicator between computer hardware and computer software applications.

## Why?

Without it, the computer will not operate the Apps we want.

## How?

Try to explain the steps among the gap between App and hardware as follow:

1. user click an app on the computer UI
2. the app start to run and it need some computation
3. the data flow to operation system
4. operation system call hardware (CPU, RAM, I/O) to compute it
5. data sent back to OS
6. OS send data back to app
7. user get what they want in UI

## What?

Typically, functions as follow:

1. memory management
2. process management
3. device management
4. file management
5. security
6. control over system performance
7. job accounting
8. error detecting aids
9. coordination between other software and users

### device management

In order to handle physical and virtual devices, device controller born in OS. Physical device includes all Input/Output devices and virtual devices mimics physical device in software, serving as device in system, making system to believe a particular hardware exists.

### file management

Recorded on secondary or non-volatile storage such as optical disks and used as medium for input and output of data.
