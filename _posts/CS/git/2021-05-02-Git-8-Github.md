### Introduction

**GitHub** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

### Why

### How

#### Create a project and push it to github with https

There are two ways:

1.  **push an existing repository from command line**

git remote add origin 'the url'  
git branch -M main  
git push -u origin main

**2\. create a new repository on the command line**

echo "# exchange" >> README.md  
git init  
git add README.md  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git branch -M main  
git remote add origin 'the url'  
git push -u origin main

#### Create a project and push it to github with ssh

#### Download a project

$ git clone "github path"

#### Delete the repository

[**Deleting a repository**  
_You can delete any repository or fork if you’re either an organization owner or have admin permissions for the…_docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/deleting-a-repository "https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/deleting-a-repository")[](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/deleting-a-repository)

#### Push

After we create a project on github as above steps and we add some changes to the code and `git commit`, we want to push it to github:

$ git push

then git will push local branch to default node; for example, after setting up default branch, `master` and default node, `origin` on github with `-u`:

$ `git push -u origin master`

then we can just

$ `git push`

next time.

**The meaning of push: for example,**

$ git push origin master:second

It means pushing master to the node, origin, and create a branch named second

**Delete a branch, for example, named second**

$ git push origin :second

It means pushing an empty to origin, and create a branch named second. Because the branch is empty, the branch disappears accordingly.

#### Fetch

Given that

1.  there is a repository on local machine and push it on github
2.  we do some commits on github so that the online progress is more forward than the local machine
3.  then after we do `git fetch` , git will ‘fetch’ the online progress to local machine.

Then the full commits look like

As you can see, there are commits from adc1a5 to 85e848 on local machine and 8c3a0a fetched from remote branch. And because these commits are on the same branch, they will be connected together with two different HEAD point on different commits.

#### Pull

Pull = fetch + merge. Because there is merge in pull, after we do `git pull,` the branch looks like

![](/Users/chenyongzhe/coding/practice_not_for_github/javascript_practice/medium-to-markdown/medium-export/posts/md_1623056197395/img/1__Q1oyPGHGAvu07__OS9IRb9A.png)

meaning it merges the branches on local machine and the version on remote node.

#### Pull Request

The meaning of pull request: request the owner of the code to pull my code, which means fetch it and merge it.

If I want to contribute to a project, then I can pull request first. After the main developer accepts it, the two version can be combined into one

First thing first, get the code so that we can modify it

$ git clone 'url'

however, after lots of modification, we want to push it and we may get rejection with no right; as a result, if we do not have the right to write into a branch of a project, we should ‘fork’ it to our github first and then do modification on it. As a result, the steps will be

fork it first to copy the project to our reporsitory

![](/Users/chenyongzhe/coding/practice_not_for_github/javascript_practice/medium-to-markdown/medium-export/posts/md_1623056197395/img/1__lgHVlwAZmL0dvgF622BD4A.png)

and clone it

$ git clone 'url'

and do modification on that forked project. After lots of modifications, create pull request; for example,

![](/Users/chenyongzhe/coding/practice_not_for_github/javascript_practice/medium-to-markdown/medium-export/posts/md_1623056197395/img/1__VcZSbSXXzCImMp0GnE5GfA.png)

After we click ‘create pull request’, the modifications will be sent to the owner of this project and if the owner accepts it, the two different versions of code will be merged together.

If you are in an organization in github and have the right to push modification directly, then you do not have to use fork first and can do pull request directly. We can still step up the review mechanism for pull request merges; for example, all members clicks accept and then pull it.

#### Management

1.  Create an organization and all repo owned by that organization
2.  To fork or not to fork? It depends, but feature branches a must
3.  All commits must go through pull requests and squash commits before merging
4.  Git pull -> git branch feature/ticket -> make changes -> commit -> git push to feature/ticket -> send PR -> Approved -> Merge
