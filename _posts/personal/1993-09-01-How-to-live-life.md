## Introduction

I never thought it is a problem until I am making 1 million NTD a year. Before it happens, I am always trying to make more because to be more tranquil, I must try to have more resources.

## Why?

This article serves a guidance to me to find a tranquil status.

## How?

I am going to decompose myself into physically outter world, emotionally inner world, and the concept of spirit and give scores (1 to 5) to these states based on tranquility and should tried my best to raise the scores.

### physically outter world

Easily, based on my observations, I decompose it into health and financial status.

There are too much noise. Given that I cannot avoid it, I should always increase my abilities for survival. That is, I should improve my technical abilities and physical abilities.

#### health status

1. (5) Body: I do not feel any pain but actually tired sometime; as a result, I will gain as much sleep as possible (sometimes over 12 hours a day)
2. (5) Diet: I can eat literally anything I want and I think it is not an issue at my age.
3. (5) Workout: I go to gym every two days and the muscles really sustain my body.
4. (3) routine: If it's possible, I tried my best to wake up at 5:30 am but cannot once there is some annoying things happens. -> **this could be an issue.** -> I should move my stuff in the morning.
5. (5) entertainment: reading, guitar, song writing, writing, side projects, taking lessons, ...etc

#### financial status

1. (5) job: I like the environment, the smart colleagues, the work hours, the learning curve, the size of the project (3 millions users)
2. (5) income: The income is promising with around 83K a month and I should keep the growth rate at around 50% annually.
3. (4) expense: the monthly expense is around 25K, which I think is enough but I think I should raise it to 33K.

### emotionally inner world

I decompose it into emotion and relationship and gosh this is the main problem here.

The noise of inner world reveals in my dreams. You cannot avoid it because those reasons causing them are reasonable at the time they happened. It is truly ambiguous to find a solution but I found writing and meditation can really help me. I should always compose something and follow master's methods.

#### emotion

1. (2) toward myself: Actually, I do not like myself -> I have to much emotions -> accidentially hurt someone -> keep as little relationships as possible to anyone -> use some talent shit to keep these relationships
2. (1) toward the past: I do not like my past -> I was a truly annoying kids always crying and emotionally break -> I just cannot deal with variant environments, so much sound, conflicts, trying to fit into society, following the rules -> I do not know how to deal with it
3. (3) toward future: Given what I have now, I think I shall start a company related to music industry -> would be promising?
4. (3) toward present: I kind of like my present status

#### relationship

1. (1) family: I grew up from a family with presistent fighting and hurt each other and themselves physically and emotionally and my parents truly desperatly tried to survive -> I should not blame them because they already tried their best -> But I felt hurt and do not know how to deal with it -> **this could be an issue**
2. (1) friends: I do not know how to keep my friends or truly I may not have a friend? -> I do not know how to deal with it but I think I should try? I should list out my friends and search about how many friends a person should have on average and keep it.
3. (1) couple: I am truly a failure -> I really do not know how to make my mate happy and I am not sure whether I should have a girlfriend -> I should dig deeper into myself and search essays about this topic.
4. (5) colleagues: I have great colleagues. They are smart and nice and I can learn lots of things from them. I appreciate I have this opportunity.

### spirit

Just follow my master.

## What?

If you do not know what to do, think about how to be tranquil.

Given the how with status score lower than 3, I should do the following things: (three aspects at most)

1. Explore the relationship with myself  -> try to express my emotions and using music currently -> **I should do more compositions**
2. Given I cannot amend my past -> I may be told to get over it -> I should explore other people's life and gain more ideas -> try to have more conversations with other people
3. Given I cannot blame my family -> try to explore the relationship with my family -> try to **follow more master's rules?**

**psycological therapy** has no effect to me.

These aspects should be reviewed once two weeks as a sprint. This sprint: 1/17 to 1/28.
