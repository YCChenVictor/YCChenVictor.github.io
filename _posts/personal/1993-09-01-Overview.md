## Intro

This article expresses my observations towards myself.

## Why

I finally know what I am looking for; that is, tranquility.

## How

Decompose myself into outer and inner aspect.

### outer

There are too much noise. Given that I cannot avoid it, I should always increase my abilities for survival. That is, I should improve my technical abilities and physical abilities.

### inner

The noise of inner world reveals in my dreams. You cannot avoid it because those reasons causing them are reasonable at the time they happened. It is truly ambiguous to find a solution but I found writing and meditation can really help me. I should always compose something and follow master's method.

## What

I should permanently exercise these activities:

### outer

body building, software training, startup building, social skills practicing, ...etc

### inner

music composing, writing, drawing, ...etc
