## Introduction

I never thought it is a problem until I am making 1 million NTD a year. I think it's time to stop pursuing the higher status in the outter world game.

## Why?

There are lots of rules to follow; for example, making more money, getting a serious relationship, traveling around the world, making good relationship between family members, helping others, keeping being thankful, ...etc

But why? I should start to explore this issue.

## How?

I really do not know how to deal with this topic, but I can systemically decompose it. Noted that the concept of spirit is not the scope of this article, although I know it exists. As a result, I am going to decompose myself into physically outter world, emotionally inner world, and the concept of spirit.

### physically outter world



### emotionally inner world



### spirit
