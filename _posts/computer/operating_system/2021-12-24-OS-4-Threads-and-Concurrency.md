## Introduction

The smallest unit of a program for CPU to execute is a thread, meaning CPU can schedule the order of threads for optimization. Given the threads to be excuted, techniques for multithread performed at the same time in the same CPU are concurrency.

## Why?

Concurrency decreases waiting time and response time and increase resource utilization and efficiency.

## How?

### decrease waiting time

### decrease response time

### increase resource utilization 

### increase efficiency

## What?
