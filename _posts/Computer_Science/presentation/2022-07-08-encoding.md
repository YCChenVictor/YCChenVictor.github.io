## Introduction

This article describes the concept of encodings with

* 7 bit ASCII (encoding): basic 128 characters
* 8 bit encodings: extensions of 7 bit ASCII
* **Unicode** (character set): put every characters in the world in a sets
* 16 bit encodings
* winner of 8 bit encoding, UTF-8

## Why?

Given character sets, we need a way to tell computers which character to use, so we need a character encoding standard for electronic communication such as ASCII.

## How?

### 7 bit ASCII

* ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange
* Why 7 bits? Computers were using 8-bit bytes when ASCII invented, so they must can store all characters and had a whole bit to spare
* 7 bits -> 128 possible values ($$2^7$$) -> use numbers, 0 ~ 127, to represent control characters (0 ~ 31) and printable characters (32 ~ 127)
* control characters: characters that don't represent printable character yet rather serves to start particular action such that 7 makes computer to beep.
* printable characters: All common characters such as a, 1, !,  , ...etc

Please refer to appendix for full list of 7 bit ASCII

### 8 bit encodings

There are more languages other than English and we can deal with them with the spare of 1 bit, so try to fill the characters other than English into 128~255 ($$2^8 = 256$$); for example,

* 8 bit single byte
  * Latin: EBCDIC
  * Western: ISO/IEC 8859, MS-Windows, MAC OS Roman
  * Russian related: KOI8, MIK
  * South Asian: ISCII, TSCII, VSCII
* 8 bit double byte
  * Japanese: JIS
  * Simplified Chinese: Guobiao
  * Traditional Chinese: Big5
  * Korean: KS X 1001
  
#### double bytes vs single byte

8 bit double bytes encoding uses two 8 bit encoding to represent a character; for example, say 7042 maps a specific character. We can split 7042 into 70 and 42 and use 8 bit encodings to transfer 70 and 42 into 106 and 52 and save this character with these two 8 bit encoding.

### Unicode (character set)

For example,

<div class="w-1/2 mx-auto">
  <img src="/assets/img/unicode_examples.png" alt="">
</div>

### 16 bits encodings

TBC

#### 16 bits vs 8 bit double encoding

TBC

### UTF-8

Given Unicode, this is possible

* 8 bit and 1 to 4 byte


The problem arouse because every language has their own characters and different versions of encoding created, causing problems when we want to **switch languages in same environment**, then wrong string showed on screen; for example,



```ruby
'a'.bytes
'あ'.bytes
'啊'.bytes
```

### unicode



#### example of unicode

16 bit: 0-9, A~F

### UTF-8

The Difference Between Unicode and UTF-8
Unicode is a character set. UTF-8 is encoding.

Unicode is a list of characters with unique decimal numbers (code points). A = 65, B = 66, C = 67, ....

This list of decimal numbers represent the string "hello": 104 101 108 108 111

Encoding is how these numbers are translated into binary numbers to be stored in a computer:

UTF-8 encoding will store "hello" like this (binary): 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100  01101111

### fix encoding bugs (這可能要放在 what)

```ruby
'a'.encoding
'あ'.encoding
'啊'.encoding
```

這邊用兩個主要的語言來講一下 ASCII，然後說明如果在同一個環境，這兩個語言是一定會互相搞砸檔案的

But still, most people just pretended that a byte was a character and a character was 8 bits and as long as you never moved a string from one computer to another, or spoke more than one language, it would sort of always work. But of course, as soon as the Internet happened, it became quite commonplace to move strings from one computer to another, and the whole mess came tumbling down. Luckily, Unicode had been invented.
