## Introduction

This article describes the concept of encodings

* 7 bit ASCII (encoding): basic 128 characters
* 8 bit encodings: extensions of 7 bit ASCII
* **Unicode** (character set): put every characters in the world in a sets
* UTF-8
* UTF-16

## Why?

Given character sets, we need a way to tell computers which character to be used, so we need a character encoding standard for electronic communication such as ASCII.

## How?

### 7 bit ASCII

* ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange
* Why 7 bits? Computers were using 8 bits when ASCII invented, so these encodings must can be stored and had a whole bit to spare
* 7 bits -> 128 possible values ($$2^7$$) -> use numbers, 0 ~ 127, to represent characters
  * control characters (0 ~ 31): not printable and start particular action such that 7 makes computer to beep.
  * printable characters (32 ~ 127): printable characters such as a, 1, !,  , ...etc

Please refer to appendix for full list of 7 bit ASCII

### 8 bit encodings

There are more languages other than English and we use following encodings to deal with them:

* 8 bit single byte
  * Latin: EBCDIC
  * Western: ISO/IEC 8859, MS-Windows, MAC OS Roman
  * Russian related: KOI8, MIK
  * South Asian: ISCII, TSCII, VSCII
* 8 bit double byte
  * Japanese: JIS
  * Simplified Chinese: Guobiao
  * Traditional Chinese: Big5
  * Korean: KS X 1001
  
#### double bytes vs single byte

8 bit double bytes encoding uses **two** 8 bit encoding to represent a character; for example, say 5BFE maps a specific character. We can split 5BFE into 5B and FE and use 8 bit encodings to transfer 5B and FE into 01011011 and 11111110 and save string with these two 8 bits. We can use various data structure to store these two 8 bit as long as they map to the character with 5BFE.

#### problem of 8 bit encodings

After **switching languages**, wrong strings may be showed on screen because every encodings has their own characters; for example, the same bytes: `11000000` represents different characters in ISO/IEC 8859-1 (`À`) and ISO/IEC 8859-2 (`Ŕ`).Here comes **Unicode** to deal with this problem.

### Unicode (character set)

For example,

<div class="w-1/2 mx-auto">
  <img src="/assets/img/unicode_examples.png" alt="">
</div>

As you can see, these characters map to a string with 4 numberings by hexadecimal system. **Using hexadecimal system for character set does not mean it is 16 bit encoding.** We can use 32 bit, 16 bit, 8 bit encoding to encode a character set; for example, UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit) uses 8 bit and up to 6 bytes to encode characters and can encode 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte code units.

### UTF-8

The following 4 steps show how to find UTF-8 encoding according to unicode of particular character.

#### (step 1) Unicode

The unicode of `啊` is `u554a`

#### (step 2) Transfer to Binary

The binary of `554a` (Hexadecimal) is 101010101001010/

#### (step 3) Insert into Encoding Table

Given the <a id="utf-8_principle" href="#utf-8_principle_example">UTF-8 table</a> in appendix, we need to use the row three; that is,

101010101001010 -> 0101 & 010101 & 001010 -> 11100101 10010101 10001010

#### (step 4) transfer back to Hexadecimal System

11100101 10010101 10001010 (binary) = E5958A (hexadecimal) and save it.

### UTF-16

Again, UTF-16 follows following 4 steps

#### (step 1) Unicode

The unicode of `啊` is `u554a`

#### (step 2) Transfer to Binary

The binary of `554a` (Hexadecimal) is 101010101001010.

#### (step 3) Insert into Encoding Table

Given the UTF-16 table in appendix, we need to use the row three; that is,

0101010101001010 -> 01010101 & 01001010 -> 00 01010101 & 10 01001010 -> 110110 00 01010101 110111 10 01001010

#### (step 4) transfer back to Hexadecimal System

11011000 01010101 11011110 01001010 (binary) -> D855DE4A (hexadecimal) and save it.

## What?

### UTF-8 dominates the web page world

</figure>

because of following reasons:

* beautiful design matches basic ASCII

```ruby
'あ'.encode(Encoding::UTF_8).bytes.map { _1. to_s(2) }
# ["11100011", "10000001", "10000010"]
```

### self-made character encoding

Steps: create a character set -> create a encoding methodology -> add into CRuby

```javascript
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
```

## Appendix

### the concept of bits

* most basic unit of digital communications
* possible value: 1 or 0
* example of 8 bit: 01011011
* in decimal system (10 進位): 01011011 = 91
* in hexadecimal system (16 進位): 01011011 = 5B
