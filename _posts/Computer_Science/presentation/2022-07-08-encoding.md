## Introduction

This article describes the concept of encodings with

* 7 bit ASCII (encoding): basic 128 characters
* 8 bit encodings: extensions of 7 bit ASCII
* **Unicode** (character set): put every characters in the world in a sets
* 16 bit encodings
* winner of 8 bit encoding, UTF-8

## Why?

Given character sets, we need a way to tell computers which character to use, so we need a character encoding standard for electronic communication such as ASCII.

## How?

### 7 bit ASCII

* ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange
* Why 7 bits? Computers were using 8-bit bytes when ASCII invented, so they must can store all characters and had a whole bit to spare
* 7 bits -> 128 possible values ($$2^7$$) -> use numbers, 0 ~ 127, to represent control characters (0 ~ 31) and printable characters (32 ~ 127)
* control characters: characters that don't represent printable character yet rather serves to start particular action such that 7 makes computer to beep.
* printable characters: All common characters such as a, 1, !,  , ...etc

Please refer to appendix for full list of 7 bit ASCII

### 8 bit encodings

There are more languages other than English and we can deal with them with the spare of 1 bit, so try to fill the characters other than English into 128~255 ($$2^8 = 256$$); for example,

* 8 bit single byte
  * Latin: EBCDIC
  * Western: ISO/IEC 8859, MS-Windows, MAC OS Roman
  * Russian related: KOI8, MIK
  * South Asian: ISCII, TSCII, VSCII
* 8 bit double byte
  * Japanese: JIS
  * Simplified Chinese: Guobiao
  * Traditional Chinese: Big5
  * Korean: KS X 1001
  
#### double bytes vs single byte

8 bit double bytes encoding uses **two** 8 bit encoding to represent a character; for example, say 5BFE maps a specific character. We can split 5BFE into 5B and FE and use 8 bit encodings to transfer 5B and FE into 01011011 and 11111110 and save string with these two 8 bits. We can use various data structure to store these two 8 bit as long as they map to the character with 5BFE.

#### problem of 8 bit encodings

When **switching languages**, we faced problems because every language has their own characters and different versions of encoding created accordingly and then wrong string showed on screen. Here comes **Unicode** to deal with this problem.

### Unicode (character set)

For example,

<div class="w-1/2 mx-auto">
  <img src="/assets/img/unicode_examples.png" alt="">
</div>

As you can see, these characters map to a string with 4 numberings by hexadecimal system. **Using hexadecimal system for character set does not mean it is 16 bit encoding.** We can use 32 bit, 16 bit, 8 bit encoding to encode a character set; for example, UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit) uses 8 bit and up to 6 bytes to encode characters and can encode 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte code units.

### UTF-8

這裡具體舉例第一個 byte 到第四個 byte encode 什麼 character

* 8 bit and 1 to 4 byte

### UTF-16

### UTF-32

* UTF-32: 
* UTF-16: 
* UTF-8: 

#### character out of the scope of 66536

example: 霅 (\u9705\u000d)

#### 16 bits vs 8 bit double encoding

## What?

the common problems in ruby

### fix encoding bugs (這可能要放在 what)

```ruby
'a'.encoding
'あ'.encoding
'啊'.encoding
```

這邊用兩個主要的語言來講一下 ASCII，然後說明如果在同一個環境，這兩個語言是一定會互相搞砸檔案的

But still, most people just pretended that a byte was a character and a character was 8 bits and as long as you never moved a string from one computer to another, or spoke more than one language, it would sort of always work. But of course, as soon as the Internet happened, it became quite commonplace to move strings from one computer to another, and the whole mess came tumbling down. Luckily, Unicode had been invented.

## Appendix

### the concept of bits

* most basic unit of digital communications
* possible value: 1 or 0
* example of 8 bit: 01011011
* in decimal system (10 進位): 01011011 = 91
* in hexadecimal system (16 進位): 01011011 = 5B
