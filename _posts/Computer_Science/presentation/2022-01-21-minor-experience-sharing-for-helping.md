## Introduction

Given my software experience, I was invited to share it. It serves as a merely one apsect of path, so pls, pls, pls take it as reference but not guidance and do not give a shit if you have your own goals.

Laissez-faire and wish you all the best!

## Why?

Given that all you want to transfer to a software engineer role and have a strong heart, I am going to share my view about junior, intermediate, and senior engineer.

## How?

My thoughts as follow: (I recommand you all should think about it too. Pls try to decompose your problem and maybe you are on a wrong track)

I really want to build a startup again, music industry espically -> I had experiences of operation, finance, fund raising, public speaking, song writing, performance -> I need software experience, backend espically -> try to gain experience -> junior role -> intermediate role -> senior role -> try to built a minimum viable product

### Junior role

In my opinion, junior role should have the abilities to complete task based on instructions. That's all. So I would expect you all have basic communication skills to understand the demands, and build the feature after my 30 seconds instruction. The quality does not matter at all. So teamwork, steady mindset, take full responsibility, basic language communication skills (in English & in technical) should be enough. You should try to prove these skills. If not, try to improve them.

### Intermediate role

skip (Given that all of you should try to be junior first)

### Senior role

skip (Given that all of you should try to be junior first)

## What?

I will give real experience examples along with your thoughts, so please feel free to ask any questions as concise as possible.
