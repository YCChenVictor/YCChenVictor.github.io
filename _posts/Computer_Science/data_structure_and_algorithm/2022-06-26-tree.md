## Introduction

* A tree is composed of nodes.
* Each tree has a root node.
* Each node has zero or more child nodes.
* The data stored in each node has any datatype.
* Three type of traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder

### essential structure

Node:

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(key, value = key, parent = null) {
    this.key = key;
    this.value = value;
    this.parent = parent;
    this.children = [];
  }

  get isLeaf() {
    return this.children === 0;
  }

  get hasChildren() {
    return !this.isLeaf;
  }
}
```

Tree:

```javascript
class Tree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TreeNode(key, value);
  }

  preOrderTraversal(node = this.root) { // I should understand the concept first
    
  }

  insert() { // we can only insert node as leaf
    
  }

  remove() {

  }

  find() {

  }
}
```

### types of tree

please add description in each types of tree

* general tree
* binary tree
* binary search tree
* balanced tree
* unbalanced tree
* complete binary tee
* full binary tree
* perfect binary tree

### types of traversal

* inorder
* preorder
* postorder

#### inorder

Given a tree as follow:



### other note

* A tree is a type of graph
* root is not necessary in graph theory

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

focus on the mechanim

## What?

give an example
