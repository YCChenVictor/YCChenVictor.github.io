## Introduction

A queue implements FIFO ordering. (add a draw here)

### Time comlexity

| :--- | :---- |
| create (add) | O(N) |
| read (peek, isEmpty) | O(1) |
| destroy (remove) | O(1) |

I need to research the time complexity

* the time complexity of add is O(N), because we need to shift the N elements
* pop

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

focus on the mechanim

## What?

give an example

## Reference
