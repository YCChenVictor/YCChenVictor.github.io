## Introduction

Before we start, please understand object-oriented programming first. (2021-11-21-object-oriented-programming.md)

Design pattern provides elegant solutions to repeating problems. There are three categories:

1. Creational patterns: different ways to create objects
2. Structural patterns: the relationship between these objects
3. Behavioral patterns: interaction or communication between these objects

## Why?

Design reusable and extensible object-oriented software

## How? & What?

Main 23 design patterns, divided by three categories, are as follow:

1. creational: factory method, builder, prototype, singleton, abstract method
2. structural: composition, decorator, adapter, proxy, bridge, facade, flyweight
3. behavioral: observer, template Method, strategy, interpreter, chain of Responsibility, command, iterator, mediator, memento, null Object, state, visitor

For more details, refer to other articles in the design pattern section.
