## Introduction

Constructs multiple intefaces for variant methods in a upper class so that we can have multiple **combinations** to create multiple classes inherit from this upper class with shared methods.

## Why?

We do not want to rewrite the same methods in different lower classes.

## How? & What

For example, given lots of varieties of dogs, there are four dogs with different **behaviors** according to their characteristics:

1. stupid dog: walks for losing its way
2. smart dog: walks to anywhere it want
3. anxious dog: kiss their owner for stroking to feel relieved
4. calm dog: kiss their owner to express intimacy

and their are four different types of dog

Given the OOP concepts, we have choices as follow:

1. create an upper class and then create four classes inherit from it
2. create an polymorhpic class with four type
