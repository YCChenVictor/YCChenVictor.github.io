## Introduction

Design pattern provides elegant solutions to repeating problems.

## Why?

Design reusable and extensible object-oriented software

## How?

There are three categories:

1. Creational patterns: different ways to create objects
2. Structural patterns: the relationship between these objects
3. behavioral patterns: interaction or communication between these objects

## What?

### Structural patterns

#### Adapter, Wrapper, or Translator

Two type: Object Adapter (with delegation) & Class Adapter (with inheritance)

I cannot tell the difference
