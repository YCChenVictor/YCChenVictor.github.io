## How
The following steps show how to build a basic app with most basic commands within rails. The steps as follow: 
1. Installation
2. Start A Project
3. Scaffold
4. Migration
5. CRUD
6. Relational

`$` means input the coding into terminal.

### Installation
```
$ gem install rails -v 5.1.1
```
The code above will install the rails version, 5.1.1

#### Check rails version
```
$ rails -v
```

### Start A Project
```
$ rails new app_name
```
If you want to create rails project with particular version, then
```
$ rails _3.2.14_ new app_name
```
;after the creation, please `cd` into the project directory and start the server with
```
$ rails s 
```
<img src="/assets/img/rails_server_start.png" alt="rails_server_start">

open browsers and input `http://localhost:3000`

<img src="/assets/img/rails_start_page.png" alt="rails_start_page">

### Scaffold

Scaffold in rails is a quick way to create MVC structure. If you want to create a MVC structure with DataBase, User (name(string), email(string), tel(string)), cd into the project directory and then type following code in terminal

```
$ rails g scaffold User name:string email:string tel:string
```

### Migration

After the step of scaffold, we need to use migration to create the tables we want in database. Input the following code

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

The file (ex: 20210204105628_create_users.rb) to create the tables is as follow
<img src="/assets/img/1__UQZ9f5TDYy2MpzaBUt__N8w.png" alt="">

After migration, start the server again

```
$ rails s
```

And input the website: [http://localhost:3000/users](http://localhost:3000/users) in browser. Then the following main page:
<img src="/assets/img/1____Yp2j7kic__5QHtdcRC2X8g.png" alt="">

### CRUD
CRUD means `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`. This four basic functions created through above codes. Let us try the functions in website.

#### Create

Click the New User in main page. Then the following webpage pops up
<img src="/assets/img/1__D9wMcZ5NloIWuuY16__z34g.png" alt="">

#### Read

After creating a user, go back to the main page
<img src="/assets/img/1__OmOa73k4TY64SO5f__nAITA.png" alt="">

#### Update

Click the button, `Edit`

#### Delete

Click the button, `Destroy`

### Relational Database in Rails

#### Create blog CRUD for users

```
$ rails g scaffold Post title:string content:text is_available:boolean user:references
```

The user:references makes this model, `Post` to refer to the pre-built model, `Users`

#### Migrate again

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Other major topics (User Name Display, N+1 Query, Gem File)

### User Name Display

let’s now solve the user name displaying problem
<img src="/assets/img/1__g4zDElZxyre__9LnjAmv2__A.png" alt="">

open `app/views/posts/index.html.erb` and then change `post.user` into `post.user.name` as follow
<img src="/assets/img/1__I63aobUinvKv8sBBIHEtaA.png" alt="">

Then the user name should be normally displayed as follow
<img src="/assets/img/1__hcpSu1BirHNjovChJtz__5A.png" alt="">

### N+1 Query

However, it causes efficiency problem. That is `N+1 Query`. Back to `http://localhost:3000/posts`
<img src="/assets/img/1__1wALyxNshVIZyRUY5EIyQw.png" alt="">

The server will run `four` queries because there are three posts according to the relational between posts and users as follow
<img src="/assets/img/1__woQozSJQ56irBRIA9iUmBw.png" alt="">

### Solution

Go to app/controllers/posts_controller.rb and change from
<img src="/assets/img/1__rfJTFmBUWfJ51L9Gr0QYbA.png" alt="">

to

<img src="/assets/img/1__7Qe5zkJXOumhxGamjgaZOg.png" alt="">

with `includes`

Then the log in the server will be like
<img src="/assets/img/1__V5jtNZUMpU__DIwwbersGnA.png" alt="">


### Gem

We can use Gem to install the packaged codes built by other; for example, to install `faker` package
```
$ gem install faker
```
Then we can use irb to test this package; for example, to create a fake emailss

### Use Gem in Rails

In Rails, there is a file called Gemfile, telling rails what package to install with the specific version

#### Gemfile full example
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'  
gem 'rails', '~> 5.1.1'  
# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record  
gem 'sqlite3'  
# Use Puma as the app server  
gem 'puma', '~> 3.7'  
# Use SCSS for stylesheets  
gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0'  
# Use Uglifier as compressor for JavaScript assets  
gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0'  
# See [https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme](https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme) for more supported runtimes  
# gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby

# Use CoffeeScript for .coffee assets and views  
gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.2'  
# Turbolinks makes navigating your web application faster. Read more: [https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)  
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'  
# Build JSON APIs with ease. Read more: [https://github.com/rails/jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder)  
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.5'  
# Use Redis adapter to run Action Cable in production  
# gem 'redis', '~> 3.0'  
# Use ActiveModel has_secure_password  
# gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'

# Use Capistrano for deployment  
# gem 'capistrano-rails', group: :development

group :development, :test do  
  # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console  
  gem 'byebug', platforms: [:mri, :mingw, :x64_mingw]  
  # Adds support for Capybara system testing and selenium driver  
  gem 'capybara', '~> 2.13'  
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'  
end

group :development do  
  # Access an IRB console on exception pages or by using <%= console %> anywhere in the code.  
  gem 'web-console', '>= 3.3.0'  
  gem 'listen', '>= 3.0.5', '< 3.2'  
  # Spring speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background. Read more: [https://github.com/rails/spring](https://github.com/rails/spring)  
  gem 'spring'  
  gem 'spring-watcher-listen', '~> 2.0.0'  
end

# Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem  
gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64\_mingw, :jruby\]
```
#### install package in rails project

For example, if we want to install package named `sqlite3` for further usage, we add the following code
```
gem 'sqlite3'
```
to gemfile first and them in terminal input the following code
```
$ bundle install
```
