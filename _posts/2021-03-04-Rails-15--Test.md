### Why writing a test?

If no testing, there would be more test in the future. With auto testing, the more function will not causing more time to test the functionality.

### How to write a test?

#### Account Balance Specification

For example, if we want to build an account system which can save, withdraw, reveal balance.

Before starting, we should write down the specification:

1.  save:

\> If there is 10 dollars already in the account, after adding 5 dollars, the balance would be 15.

\> If there is 10 dollars, after adding -5 dollars, the balance is still 10. meaning the amount of dollar cannot be negative.

2\. withdraw:

\> If there is 10 dollars already in the account, after withdrawing 5 dollars, the balance would be 5.

\> If there is 10 dollars already in the account and trying to withdraw 20 dollars, the balance is still 10 dollars.

\> If there is 10 dollars, after withdrawing -5 dollar, the balance is still 10 dollars.

#### Install RSpec

$ gem install rspec

#### Write the test file

Turn specification into test file, bank\_account\_spec.rb

RSpec.describe BankAccount do  
    
  describe "save function" do  
    it "If there is 10 dollars already in the account, after adding 5 dollars, the balance would be 15"  
    it "If there is 10 dollars, after adding -5 dollars, the balance is still 10. meaning the amount of dollar cannot be negative"  
  end  
    
  describe "withdraw function" do  
    it "If there is 10 dollars already in the account, after withdrawing 5 dollars, the balance would be 5"  
    it "If there is 10 dollars already in the account and trying to withdraw 20 dollars, the balance is still 10 dollars"  
    it "If there is 10 dollars, after withdrawing -5 dollar, the balance is still 10 dollars"  
  end  
end

### Use a test

Then we can use the test, bank\_account\_spec.rb

$ rspec bank\_account\_spec.rb

error:

![](/Users/chenyongzhe/coding/practice_not_for_github/javascript_practice/medium-to-markdown/medium-export/posts/md_1623056197395/img/1__iJwOlbAmm6WbzezhIlHXbg.png)

which means there is no BankAccout. Then create one, `./bank_account.rb` :

class BankAccount  
end

and add

require "./bank\_account"

to the first line of `bank_account_spec.rb`

Then do the testing again:

$ rspec bank\_account\_spec.rb

The following message pops up

![](/Users/chenyongzhe/coding/practice_not_for_github/javascript_practice/medium-to-markdown/medium-export/posts/md_1623056197395/img/1__XsUeZLKOoNJENyU0aT5w6w.png)

There are 5 pending test going to be add because there are 5 it.

\* means pending, . means success, and F means failure. The first line is \*\*\*\*\* meaning there are 5 test pending.

Then we should continue to build test. In `bank_account_spec.rb`

require "./bank\_account"

RSpec.describe BankAccount do  
  describe "save function" do  
    it "If there is 10 dollars already in the account, after adding 5 dollars, the balance would be 15" do  
      account = BankAccount.new(10)  
      account.deposit 5  
      expect(account.balance).to be 15  
    end

    it "If there is 10 dollars, after adding -5 dollars, the balance is still 10. meaning the amount of dollar cannot be negative"  
  end

  describe "withdraw function" do  
  end  
end

Notice, there are three method added, new, deposit, balance, which is going to be added. Let’s run the test first:

$ rspec bank\_account\_spec.rb

Except 4 pendings, we can see 1 failure with errors such as no initialize and no new method

![](/Users/chenyongzhe/coding/practice_not_for_github/javascript_practice/medium-to-markdown/medium-export/posts/md_1623056197395/img/1__2Ef4pd2u__b3lccQP54G3KA.png)

Then let’s add the methods. In `./bank_account.rb` :

class BankAccount  
    
  def initialize(amount)  
    [@amount](http://twitter.com/amount "Twitter profile for @amount") = amount  
  end

  def balance  
    [@amount](http://twitter.com/amount "Twitter profile for @amount")  
  end

  def deposit(amount)  
    [@amount](http://twitter.com/amount "Twitter profile for @amount") += amount  
  end

end

Then rum the test again:

![](/Users/chenyongzhe/coding/practice_not_for_github/javascript_practice/medium-to-markdown/medium-export/posts/md_1623056197395/img/1__svumF__piK__Zja4I7AOaUcQ.png)

The failure disappears and there are still 4 pendings.

Then keep creating methods in test file and keep the pending and failures disappear.
